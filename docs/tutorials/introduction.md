These tutorials are intended to provide more information about particular aspects of functionality. Unlike the 
[User Guides](../user-guides/introduction.md), which explain _how_ to achieve things in **Mauro Data Mapper**, these Tutorials will explain _why_ such 
functionality is available and how it is intended to be used.

Our current Tutorials:

---

---

[Properties and Profiles](properties-profiles.md)

using profiles.
