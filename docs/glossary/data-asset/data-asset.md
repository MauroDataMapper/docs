##What is a Data Asset?

There are two types of [Data Models](../data-model/data-model.md) within [Mauro Data Mapper](https://modelcatalogue.cs.ox.ac.uk/mdm-ui/#/home):

* **Data Asset**
* [Data Standard](../data-standard/data-standard.md)

A **Data Asset** contains existing data. This can be in the form of a database, dataset or a number of completed forms.

##How are Data Assets used?

A **Data Model** which is a **Data Asset** is represented by a database icon, as shown below. This helps to quickly identify the type of **Data Model** in the **Model Tree**.

**Data Assets** may also include summary metadata within its properties and its data can also be populated from other **Data Assets** via a [Dataflow](../dataflow/dataflow.md). 

###Selecting a Data Model type

You will need to assign a **Data Model** type whenever you are adding or importing a **Data Model**. 

When adding a **Data Model**, select the type from the dropdown menu on the **'Data Model Details form'**. For further information on this, visit our ['Create a Data Model user guide'](../../user-guides/create-a-data-model/create-a-data-model.md).

When importing a **Data Model** using Excel, you will need to specify the type in the relevant column of the [Data Model listing sheet](../../user-guides/import-data-model-from-excel/import-data-model-from-excel.md#listing-sheet). For further information on this, please see our ['Import a Data Model from Excel user guide'](../../user-guides/import-data-model-from-excel/import-data-model-from-excel.md).
