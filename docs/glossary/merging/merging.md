## What is Merging?

To **Merge** a model means to _combine_ the contents of one [Branch](../branch/branch.md) into another. **Merging** branches can be simple when there are few edits, but in complex scenarios with multiple edits made, merging may require manual intervention to determine what conflicted changes must be resolved, and how.

**Merging** is usually the final set of actions to perform when creating [Branch](../branch/branch.md) to work on changes in isolation. It is usual to merge the changes from one branch back into the **main** branch.
