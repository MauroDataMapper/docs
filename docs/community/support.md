We have an active and ever growing community of **Mauro Data Mapper** users in a variety of different application domains. As an open source project, we encourage all
our users to interact and help solve problems, share experience or offer advice. The main channel for this is our
new [Zulip organisation](https://maurodatamapper.zulipchat.com) which we encourage all potential users to visit. 

In addition to active users and
contributors, the core development team are also active on Zulip and able to help with any technical questions. You can log into our Zulip organisation
using your GitHub credentials, or alternatively ask an existing member to send you an invite.

Note that although our Slack channels are still open for the core development team, we will be migrating all previous channels / conversations to
Zulip where appropriate.

## Reporting Issues

The **Mauro** team are keen to hear of any bugs, performance problems or other issues that may be affecting your experience of using the tools.  

The core development team run an instance of JetBrains YouTrack for managing issues. You can view current issues or submit new ones through hosted
instances of the Web Interface. Click the **'Report Issue'** link in the footer of the page. When an error is encountered through the web interface,
there is also an option to submit a new issue directly. This will include any debug details necessary for the development team to investigate.

Please first check to see if your issue has been previously reported. If in doubt, submit a new issue, but in many cases it may be more helpful to add
additional context or examples to an existing issue rather than creating another.

When submitting issues in this way, please record your name in the **'Reporters Name'** field. This will allow the development team to follow up with
further questions or reports on progress. Please also do include any additional information that will allow the development team to better understand
your issue. There are many online guides to help you write good bug reports - one such example
[is here](https://medium.com/pitch-perfect/how-to-write-the-perfect-bug-report-6430f5a45cd).

As well as YouTrack, you can also submit issues to our GitHub organisations. Please try to report issues against the correct repository. Back-end
issues should be submitted against [mdm-core](https://github.com/MauroDataMapper/mdm-core/issues) while user interface issues should be submitted against
[mdm-ui](https://github.com/MauroDataMapper/mdm-ui/issues) and so on.

## Requesting Features

The core team are very pleased to receive suggestions for new features or improvements to the tools - especially those that will benefit a wide
audience or encourage adoption of the tools. 

Our [Development Roadmap](../about/development-roadmap.md) page shows a few items that are either in
progress or planned for development in the near future. The team may also be engaged in other funded projects with other deliverables not reported 
on that page, so do please discuss with the team if there are features that you would find useful.  In particular, early feedback can ensure we cater 
for as many use-cases as possible when building new functionality and we can let you know directly once support is in progress, ready for testing,
or available as part of a tagged code release.

Visit our [Zulip organisation](https://maurodatamapper.zulipchat.com) to discuss new features and get in touch with the development team directly.
