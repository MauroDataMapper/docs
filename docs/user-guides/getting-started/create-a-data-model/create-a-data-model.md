## **1. Create a new folder**
Data Models are stored in their own folders and subfolders which are displayed in the Model tree. Therefore, to create a new Data Model, first you need to either create a new folder, or add a subfolder.
To create a new folder click the **'Create a new Folder'** icon at the top right of the Finder Panel. Enter a Folder name and click **'Add folder'**. Your new folder should now appear in the Model tree.

To create a new subfolder, right click on the existing folder you want and select **'Add Folder'**. Enter a folder name and click **'Add folder'**. Your new subfolder should appear within the relevant folder in the Model tree.

Whenever you create a folder you should also enter a short description detailing the purpose of the folder. To do this, select your new folder in the Model tree and click the **'Edit'** button. This will allow you to enter text into the description box. Once completed, click **'Save changes'** and the description will now display whenever the folder is selected.

Please complete both the mandatory and optional fields on the New Data Model form, with the defintions of each field detailed below:

* **Author**  
	Use this field to record the name(s) of the authors who are creating and maintaining this Data Model.

* **Organisation**  
	This is the name of the organisation responsible for the Data Model, or the underlying data asset or standard.

While a **Data Standard** is a template for data that is to be colleced such as a form or schema.

* **Classifier**  
	Enter the relevant classifier by either selecting from the existing list in the dropdown menu, or by typing a name to create a new classifier. You may enter multiple classifiers.
