## 2. Model management

As an administrator, you can delete several elements such as [Data Models](../../glossary/data-model/data-model.md) and [Terminologies](../../glossary/terminology-data-type/terminology-data-type.md). 

To do this, select **'Model management'** from the user profile dropdown menu. Select the relevant options to filter elements by type and status and the **Model Tree** displayed at the bottom of the page will automatically filter. 

Once you've found the element you wish to delete, click the checkbox until a green tick appears. You can do this for multiple elements and a summary list will be displayed on the right. Here, you will then have the option to either **'Delete Permanently'** or **'Mark as Deleted'** the list of elements.
