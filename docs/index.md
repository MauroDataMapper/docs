# Metadata Catalogue documentation


!!! Warning
    These pages are very much work-in-progress and should not be treated as definitive.
    
    Whilst these pages are under construction, the layout, formatting and organisation may change.    
      
This documentation is split into several parts:

- An [introduction](introduction.md), to give an overview of the Metadata Catalogue, its intended functionality, and its intended usage. ()
- A set of tutorials, designed to assist users in understanding the catalogue concepts and carrying out common tasks.  Visit the first one here
: [Using the Metadata Catalogue to Document Health Datasets](tutorial/document-assets/index.md)
- A set of more fundamental user guides, explaining in more detail how to interact with the catalogue and detailing the options available.  Visit
 the first one here: [Creating a DataModel](user/models.md)
- Detailed guides to the REST-style API - these pages are suitable for developers intending to write scripts or applications that programmatically
 interact with the system.  Read the [Introduction here](rest-api/introduction.md)
