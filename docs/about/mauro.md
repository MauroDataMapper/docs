## **Who is Mauro?**
The Mauro Data Mapper is named after Fra Mauro who was a 15th century Venetian Monk and also a famous cartographer. He created the most detailed map of the world at the time, which featured thousands of texts and illustrations.

Unlike other explorers who would embark on expeditions to gather their own data about the world, Mauro adopted a different approach and based himself at the port in Venice. He interviewed travellers who would give their detailed interpretations of the countries they had visited. Mauro then merged this information together to generate maps which were rich with contextual data. 

This philosophy lies at the heart of the Mauro Data Mapper, which not only aims to be a hub of detailed **metadata**, but also allows users to make and share their own perceptions.
