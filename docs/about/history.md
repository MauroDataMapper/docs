The team at Oxford have been building Metadata Registries for more than a decade; the Mauro Data Mapper is the latest incarnation. Previous
implementations have been known as "Metadata Registry", "Model Catalogue" and "Metadata Catalogue". The original ideas are based on our engagement
with the international standards community [11179](), and our experience of modelling clinical trials data and workflows.
