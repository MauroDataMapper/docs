# Mauro Data Mapper Documentation

This repository is for the documentation of the Mauro Data Mapper

## Requirements

* [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) : pip install mkdocs
* [PyMdown Extensions](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions) : pip install pymdown-extensions
* [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material) : pip install mkdocs-material



After installing MkDocs, you can clone this directory, and from inside run:
