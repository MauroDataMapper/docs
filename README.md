# Mauro Data Mapper Documentation

This repository is for the documentation of the Mauro Data Mapper

It is built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org), which uses Markdown syntax, and a custom theme.

After installing MkDocs, you can clone this directory, and from inside run:

```$bash
$ mkdocs serve
```

This will build and run the site in 'responsive' mode, rebuilding when changes are made.
